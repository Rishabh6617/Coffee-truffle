To make these truffles, simply start by adding the chocolate and heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30 second intervals, stirring after each one, until melted and smooth.

Add the butter and coffee granules and stir in until completely smooth and combined. Cover the bowl with clingfilm, and refrigerate until the chocolate is firm – I like to leave mine in the fridge overnight.

Once firm, roll the mixture into 1oz balls, and place them onto a baking tray lined with parchment or wax paper. Freeze the truffles for 30 minutes.

TIP: If the mixture starts to become too sticky/melty to roll, coat your hands with cocoa powder to make the process easier.

For the coating, add the chocolate and coconut oil to a microwave-safe bowl, and heat in 30 second intervals, stirring after each one, until melted and smooth.

Dip each truffle into the melted chocolate, place back onto the baking tray, and refrigerate until set. I drizzled my truffles with white chocolate – makes them look extra pretty!
